<h1 class="about">About Project üçµ</h1>
<br>
<p class="about"> This is a <strong>FAKE</strong> store intended just for learning purposes. Since
    I, unlike the majority of students who depend on coffee, prefer Mate instead, thought it would be a cool
    project to practice some of the MVC concepts learned from lectures, perform some CRUD operations with a database as
    well as just further develop my web development skills in Node.js, to produce a small product landing page
    for some yerba mate products with filtering options alongside some verification aspects such as signing up and loging in as well as implementing
    a basket for the user. </p>
