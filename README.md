<h1> Brief Description </h1>

This is a FAKE store intended just for learning purposes. Since I, unlike the majority of students who depend on coffee, prefer Mate instead, thought it would be a cool project to practice some of the MVC concepts learned from lectures, perform some CRUD operations with a database as well as just further develop my web development skills in Node.js, to produce a small product landing page for some yerba mate products with filtering options alongside some verification aspects such as signing up and loging in as well as implementing a basket for the user.
